## ⚠️ Archive Notice

In 2016, I co-founded Oswald Labs, an accessibility technology company. This repository contains the earliest version of our dashboard to manage our web accessibility plugin, which was hosted on https://oswald.tech. Since then, we've come a long way with our platform — which is also open source.

Before you continue on to the README, here are some links:
